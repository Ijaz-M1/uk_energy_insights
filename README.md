### Introduction:
In this project, I analysed energy data from the UK for the year 2017. The goal was to extract meaningful insights and answer critical business questions that could inform stakeholders and guide strategic decisions. Using Power BI, I created a series of visualisations to illustrate key trends and comparisons in energy production, consumption, and demand. Below, I outline the business questions addressed and the insights gained from them.

## 1. Line Chart: Trends in Energy Production and Consumption
Business Question: "How has energy production and consumption trends changed over the year?"
#### Visualisation Details:
This line chart illustrates monthly trends in energy production and consumption throughout 2017, allowing stakeholders to compare fluctuations and identify patterns.
#### Insights:
Quarterly:
- Increase from Quarter 1 to Quarter 2:
Notable rise from winter to spring, likely due to longer days and milder weather boosting both demand and production.
- Peak in Quarter 3:
Aligns with summer months, where increased cooling needs drive higher consumption and production scales accordingly.
- Aligned Patterns:
Both metrics follow the same pattern, indicating a robust correlation and efficient energy sector.

Monthly:
- Consistent Overproduction:
The UK always produces more energy than it consumes, ensuring a stable supply and buffer for demand spikes.
- Visible Dips:
February, May, September, and November show dips likely due to seasonal changes such as post-winter lull, moderate spring temperatures, end of summer, and pre-winter lull.

Daily:
- No Significant Daily Trends:
Daily data shows minimal fluctuations, with more visible patterns observed on a monthly and quarterly basis.

#### Discussing Discrepancies Between Production and Consumption:
- Weather Conditions:
Extreme weather events can cause sudden spikes in consumption.
- Policy Changes:
Government initiatives promoting renewable energy or energy-saving measures could temporarily affect production or consumption patterns.

#### Impact on Energy Planning and Resource Allocation:
- Strategic Planning:
Understanding these trends aids in planning for seasonal demands, ensuring sufficient reserves, and avoiding shortages during peak periods.
- Sustainability Goals:
Identifying peak consumption periods can help promote energy efficiency programs and renewable energy initiatives to reduce carbon footprints during high-demand months.

These insights provide a clear understanding of the UK's energy production and consumption dynamics, helping stakeholders plan and optimise for seasonal variations and ensure a reliable energy supply.

## 2. Pie Chart: Share of Renewable Energy Production
Business Question: "What is the share of renewable energy production compared to non-renewable sources?"
#### Visualisation Details:
The pie chart offers a clear representation of the proportion of total energy production that comes from renewable sources such as solar, wind, and hydro. This visualisation is essential for assessing the progress towards sustainability goals and understanding the role of renewables in the energy mix.
#### Insights:
The chart shows that renewable energy sources (wind, hydro, solar) and non-renewable sources (fossil fuels, nuclear) each account for 50% of the total energy production. This equal distribution highlights a balanced approach towards energy sourcing in the UK.

The equal share of renewable energy indicates significant progress towards adopting sustainable energy practices. The continued investment in wind, hydro, and solar energy will be crucial for further growth. Monitoring these trends over time can reveal areas with the most potential for increased renewable energy production.
#### Implications for Environmental Policy and Energy Strategy:
The substantial share of renewable energy production supports the UKâ€™s commitment to reducing carbon emissions and achieving sustainability goals. Policymakers can use this data to advocate for further incentives and subsidies for renewable energy projects. Additionally, the balanced energy mix suggests a resilient energy strategy that can mitigate risks associated with over-reliance on any single energy source.

By visualising the share of renewable and non-renewable energy production, stakeholders can better understand the current state of the UK's energy mix and make informed decisions to support the transition to a more sustainable energy future.

## 3. Clustered Column Chart: Peak vs. Off-Peak Demand
Business Question: "What are the peak and off-peak energy demand trends across regions?"
#### Visualisation Details:
This clustered column chart compares the peak and off-peak energy demand across different regions. By understanding these demand patterns, stakeholders can optimise energy distribution, plan for capacity expansions, and improve grid reliability.
#### Insights:
Scotland has the highest peak demand, closely followed by England. Possible causes for high peak demand could include colder weather in Scotland, leading to increased heating needs, and higher population density in England, driving overall higher consumption.

All regions show a significant difference between peak and off-peak demand. England exhibits the highest off-peak demand, indicating more consistent usage patterns, whereas Northern Ireland and Wales have slightly lower off-peak demands, suggesting more variability in their energy consumption.
#### Strategies for Managing Demand:
- Demand Response Programs:
Implementing programs that incentivise consumers to reduce or shift their usage during peak times can help balance the load.
- Regional Tailoring:
Specific strategies tailored to the unique needs and patterns of each region can optimise energy use. For example, enhancing heating efficiency programs in Scotland or promoting energy-saving practices in England.

By analysing peak and off-peak demand patterns, stakeholders can make informed decisions to enhance energy distribution, plan for future capacity needs, and ensure a reliable energy supply across the UK.

## 4. Stacked Bar Chart: Energy Production by Region and Source
Business Question: "Which regions produce the most energy, and what are the primary sources?"
#### Visualisation Details:
The stacked bar chart provides a breakdown of energy production by region, segmented by the type of energy source. This visualisation highlights regional differences in energy production capacity and the reliance on various energy sources. It is crucial for understanding regional strengths and weaknesses in energy infrastructure.
#### Insights:
Wales leads in total energy production, closely followed by Scotland, England, and Northern Ireland. The higher energy output in Wales and Scotland is likely due to their significant investments in renewable energy sources.
#### Regional Energy Policies or Geographic Advantages That May Influence These Patterns:
- Wales:
  
1) Geographic advantages such as abundant water resources support hydroelectric power.

2) Policies promoting renewable energy investment.
- Scotland:
  
1) Favourable conditions for solar energy production.

2) Strong nuclear energy infrastructure.
- England:
  
1) Large nuclear facilities driving high production.

2) Balanced energy policy supporting both fossil fuels and renewables.
- Northern Ireland:
  
1) High wind energy potential due to geographic location.

2) Continued reliance on fossil fuels highlights the need for diversification.

By understanding the regional differences in energy production and source reliance, stakeholders can tailor energy policies, optimise infrastructure investments, and promote regional strengths to ensure a balanced and sustainable energy future.
